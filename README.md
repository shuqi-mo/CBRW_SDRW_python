# CBRW_SDRW_python

**CBRW (Coupled Biased Random Walk)** and **SDRW (Subgraph Density-augmented Random Walk)** are anomaly detection methods for non-IID categorical data. This repository implements these two methods in Python :)

The dataset used in the jupyter notebook can be found in https://sites.google.com/site/gspangsite/sourcecode/categoricaldata
